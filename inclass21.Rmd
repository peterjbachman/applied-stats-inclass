\section*{In-class Background: The Expectation-Maximization Algorithm}

The goal of this in-class exercise is to implement an ensemble of models. You
will combine forecasts of US presidential elections using ensemble Bayesian
model averaging (EBMA). To do this, you must decide how to weight each component
of the forecast in the prediction. The collection of these weighted forecasts
form the ensemble, and you will use something called the EM
(expectation-maximization) algorithm.

The task is to choose values $w_k$ that maximize the following equation:

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
   p(y \vert f_1^{s \vert t^{\star}}, ..., f_K^{s \vert t^{\star}}) = \sum\limits^N_{k=1} w_k N(f_k^{t^{\star}}, \sigma^{2})
\end{equation}
```
For the remainder of this assignment, assume that the parameter $\sigma^{2}$ is
known and that $\sigma^{2} = 1$.

The first step of the EM algorithm is to estimate the latent quantity
$\hat{z}^t_k$ that represents the probability that observation $t$ was best
predicted by model $k$.

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
   \hat{z}_k^{(j+1)t} = \frac{\hat{w}_k^{(j)} N(y^t \vert f_k^t, 1)}{\sum\limits^N_{k=1} \hat{w}_k^{(j)} N(y^t \vert f_k^t, 1)}
\end{equation}
```
In this equation, $j$ is the particular iteration of the EM algorithm, and
$N(y^t \vert f_k^t, 1)$ is the normal cumulative distribution function evaluated
at the observed election outcome (\texttt{dnorm(y, ftk, 1)}).

The second step of the EM algorithm is to estimate the expected value of the
weights assuming that all $\hat{z}^{t}_{k}$ are correct.

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
   \hat{w}^{(j+1)}_k = \frac{1}{n} \sum_t \hat{z}_k^{(j+1)t}
\end{equation}
```
\newpage

The estimation procedure is as follows:

```{=tex}
\begin{enumerate}
   \item Start with the assumption that all models are weighted equally.
   \item Calculate $\hat{z}_k^{(j+1)t}$ for each model for each election.
   \item Calculate $\hat{w}_k^{(j+1)}$ for each model.
   \item Repeat steps 2-3 twenty times.
\end{enumerate}
```
Complete the preceding tasks in \texttt{R} alone.

# **ANSWERS**: R Section.

## **FIRST**: find test data to use on our model.

  * we use the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm on datasets that combine multiple linear models. In this case, we combine different forecasts of US presidential elections using EBMA.

  * To learn more about EBMA forecasts and (hopefully) find some toy data to use with our functions, let's install and investigate the `EBMAforecast` package.

```{r tidy = TRUE}
## Install package:

#install.packages("EBMAforecast")
library(EBMAforecast)

## Read documentation:

#?EBMAforecast

## Find data used in demo(PresForecast):

#demo(presForecast)
```

  * Let's load the `presidentialForecast` data from the `EBMAforecast` package:

```{r tidy = TRUE}
## Load `presidentialForecast` data from `EBMAforecast` package:
data("presidentialForecast")
#?presidentialForecast

df <- presidentialForecast

## OUTCOME VARIABLE: incumbent-party vote share in each presidential election. In this dataset, the actual outcome is the column `Actual`.
y <- df$Actual

# Now that the outcome variable `y` is another object, remove column `Actual` from `df`, which now represents the matrix of models (analogous to matrix of X's)
df <- df[,-7]
```

## **SECOND**: implement steps 1-3 above.
For the remaining R code, let's first develop code for each of the steps referenced above before properly structuring them in a for-loop.

### 1. **Start with the assumption that all models are weighted equally**.

**NOTE**: recall from Montgomery, Hollenbach, and Ward (2012) that the $w_k \in [0,1]$'s are model probabilities associated with each component model's predictive performance.
In other words, the $w_k \in [0,1]$'s are weights associated each each model such that $\sum_{k=1}^K w_k = 1$.

**ASSUMED DATA STRUCTURE**: 

  * dataframe `df` with the following dimensions:

    + `K` columns, which include `K` columns of models
  
    + `T` rows of predictions (substantively, these are the predicted incumbent-party vote share for each presidential election).
  
  * Vector `y` with `T` elements. 

    + Each element $t \in T$ of `y` represents the actual results of one presidential election.

```{r tidy = TRUE}
## Find number of models:
K <- dim(df)[2] - 1

## Find the number of observations (in this case, presidential elections):
T <- dim(df)[1]

## Define w_hat with all models weighted equally.
w_hat <- replicate(K,1/K)

## COMPLETE!
```

### 2. **Calculate $\hat{z}_k^{(j+1)t}$ for each model for each election**.

**NOTE**: the function $\hat{z}_k^{(j+1)t} = \frac{\hat{w}_k^{(j)} N(y^t \vert f_k^t, 1)}{\sum\limits^N_{k=1} \hat{w}_k^{(j)} N(y^t \vert f_k^t, 1)}$ is complex, containing several unexplained terms. Let's consider each of these terms:

  * Recall from above that `j` represents the prior iteration of the EM algorithm, so the EM algorithm is recursive. 
  
  * Also recall from above that $\hat{z}_k^t$ is the probability that observation `t`  (i.e., a particular presidential election; one row in the test dataset) was best predicted by model `k` (i.e., one column in the test dataset).
  
  * Also recall from above that $\hat{w}_k^{(j)}$ is the probability weights for each model `k`. We assume that all $\hat{w}_k^{(j)}$'s in the first iteration.
  
  * $y^t$ is the *actual* election result of presidential election `t` (i.e., row `t`'s entry of column `Actual` in the test dataset).
  
  * $f_k^t$ is model `k`'s *predicted* election result for presidential election `t` (i.e., row `t`'s entry of column associated with model `k`).
  
  * $N(y^t \vert f_k^t, 1)$, then, is the probability that model `k` found predicted outcome $f_k^t$ for presidential election `t` given that the sample distribution is normally distributed around the actual outcome $y^t$ with st. dev. $\sigma^2 = 1$ Generate $N(y^t \vert f_k^t, 1)$ using `norm(y, ftk, 1)` where `y` $=y^t$ and `ftk` $=f_k^t$.
  
  * Finally, note that the outcome of this step will be a vector because the numerator $\hat{w}_k^{(j)} N(y^t \vert f_k^t, 1)$ is a vector of `K` elements for EACH model's `w_hat`, while the denominator $\sum\limits^N_{k=1} \hat{w}_k^{(j)} N(y^t \vert f_k^t, 1)$ is a scalar that's the sum of the numerator for each model `k`.
  
With this knowledge in mind, let's create code that estimates $\hat{z}_k^{(j+1)t}$:
  
```{r eval = FALSE}
## NOTE 1: `y = df$Actual`.

## NOTE 2: `k` denotes the current model (column `k` of `K`).

## NOTE 3: `t` denotes the current prior presidential election (row `t` of `T`).

## NOTE 4: input `w_hat` and output `z_hat` are vectors of `K` elements.

z_hat <- (w_hat * dnorm(y[t], df[t,k], 1)/(sum(w_hat * dnorm(y[t], df[t,k], 1)))
```

### 3. **Calculate $\hat{w}_k^{(j+1)}$ for each model**.

Whereas step (2) estimated $\hat{z}_k^{(j+1)t}$ (the probability that model `k` best predicted the outcome of ONE presidential election `t`), step (3) determines the next iteration's $\hat{w}_k^{(j+1)}$ (i.e., the weight associated with model `k`) by finding the average $\hat{z}_k^{(j+1)t}$ over ALL presidential elections (i.e., $\forall t \in T$).

```{r eval = FALSE}
## NOTE 1: input `z_hat` and output `w_hat` are vectors of `K` elements.

## NOTE 2: `T = dim(df)[1]`, or the number of all presidential elections in sample.
w_hat <- sum(z_hat)/T
```

## **THIRD**: perform step (4). 
perform step (4) above by creating a for-loop that repeats steps 2-3 twenty times.

This step pulls everything together. In brief, there will be two for-loops:

  * The first (or "inner") for-loop will operate on one presidential election `t` at a time. It will perform 

```{r}

```





```{r eval = FALSE}
# Eventually wrap everything in a loop, or apply function?

# Calculate zHat

# I'm not sure if the indices are in the right places. This is mostly because
# I'm not entirely sure what's going on
zHat[i + 1] <- (wHat[i] * dnorm(y[i], ftk[i], 1)) / sum(wHat * dnorm(y, ftk, 1))

# Calculate wHat

# Not sure for the same reasons as above.
wHat[i + 1] <- sum(zHat) / length(zHat)

```
